'''
mplement int sqrt(int x).

Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

Example 1:

Input: 4
Output: 2

class Solution:
    def mySqrt(self, x):
        l, r = 0, x
        while l <= r:
            mid = l + (r-l)//2
            if mid * mid <= x < (mid+1)*(mid+1):
                return mid
            elif x < mid * mid:
                r = mid
            else:
                l = mid + 1
